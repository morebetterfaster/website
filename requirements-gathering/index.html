          Gathering requirements for a new project can get unwieldy and unorganized pretty easily. It's easy to get lost
          or go down a deep rabbit hole. You may be getting excited about the new project's technical challenges or be
          blindly following the client's explanation and description. How do you know you've covered everything, though?
          What if you're missing vital points?
        </p>
        <p>
          No project is exactly the same, so it's very difficult to make an exact blueprint of the questions you need to
          ask. However, there are many common patterns and themes in most projects. I've created a set of questions that
          form the basis of my requirements gathering conversation and I'll share them below.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôre a developer or consultant, you can use these to help you during your client conversations. I
          would suggest using them as a guide to create your own project-specific questionnaire or outline.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôre a prospective business client, you can follow along with this article to prepare for the likely
          questions that will be asked during the requirements gathering process of your engagement with More
          Better Faster.

        <h3>What Questions Should I Ask?</h3>
        <p>
          The following is an outline of the general topics to cover during a requirements gathering meeting for
          software and web application projects. The goal is to make sure no area or concept is forgotten. However, not
          all questions will apply to every project.
        </p>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What are you building?</li>
          <li>Why are you building it?</li>
          <li>If everything goes the right way, what does 1 year, and 3 years from now look like with this project?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the main features?</li>
          <li>What are some nice-to-have features, or things that you know are in the future?</li>

              <li>Will there be user levels/types/roles?</li>
              <li>Social login? Email login? Combination?</li>

              <li>Can you ban users?</li>
              <li>If using emails, can emails be re-used?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <ul>

              <li>Do you have or need a payment provider?</li>
              <li>Do you have a mailing list provider?</li>
              <li>How about CRM/Marketing Automation?</li>
              <li>Any in-house or proprietary systems to integrate with?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Technical</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do you have an existing tech team that you work with? If so...

        </ul>

          <li>What process do you have for testing and user acceptance?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>But Why These Questions?</h2>
        <p>
          Some of these questions are pretty self explanatory. Others may seem a bit confusing or even silly. But, each
          has a reason and a point. While the details of each question is beyond the scope of this article, the do fall
          into three main categories or reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, functionality. What types of features are expected? How do they relate to each other? Which are the
          most important so they can be prioritized. Which leads to the second category: implementation. Which order
          should the features be added? Can they be stepped into production or do they need to go all at once? Are there
          existing teams, infrastructures and products, rules and laws that we need to know about?
          Finally, what does the future look like? Who holds the keys to the project going forward? What kind of support
          is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may find yourself digging into some areas more than others. For example, if this is a highly regulated
          industry, you might spend more time on the laws and certifications. For workflow tools, you might focus more
          on product integrations. Remember, these questions are just a base.

        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>
          Requirements gathering can be hard, and each project is unique, but that doesn't mean that it can't be done
          successfully. When you use a base set of questions, you can be pretty certain you will cover topics and strike
          up conversations that will flesh out the requirements pretty well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're set with gathering your requirements, you should move onto <a
            href="/requirements-documentation">writing requirements documentation</a>. I have some guidance as well as
          an <a href="/requirements-documentation">example wireframe and requirements document</a> to help you get
          started.
