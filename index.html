          <h3>How I Implement Processes</h3>
          <p>
            We're not robots, so sometimes we need a little process help. Since
            programming projects require precise accuracy and measurement, good
            process is essential. Let me help set it up.
          </p>
          <h4>Requirements Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            Analyzing the requirements before coding helps clarify business
            objectives and eliminate rework. Before any programming begins, the
            first step is a thorough review of the requirements.
          </p>
          <h4>Wireframes Before Code</h4>
          <p>
            To remove abstraction, wireframes are made to demonstrate the user
            experience and flow of any solution. Since interpretations differ,
            you can get an idea of how your project will function and get
            stakeholder buy-in before development begins.
          </p>
          <h4>Milestones</h4>
          <p>
            While a guaranteed completion date sounds great, requirements change
            and needs evolve often making the date unreliable. Milestones give
            multiple check points to review and alter the project plan while
            allowing flexibility.

          <h3>Programming with Best Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Let's not re-invent the wheel. Many have come before us, let's learn
            from them. I use best practices with proven, stable technology to
            solve problems the right way.
