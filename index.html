          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you‚Äôre a <dfn title="üê∫">lone-wolf</dfn> or
            <dfn title="üëë">managing</dfn> a group, when you add me to your team
            I bring industry best practices and solid development processes. You
            have a great project, product and company. Let me help you make it
            More, Better, Faster.

          <h3>How I Implement Processes</h3>
          <p>
            We're not <dfn title="ü§ñ">robots</dfn>, so sometimes we need a
            little process help. Since programming projects require precise
            accuracy and measurement, good process is essential. Let me help set
            it up.

              <h4>Requirements Analysis</h4>
              <p>
                Analyzing the requirements before coding helps clarify business
                objectives and eliminate rework. Before any programming begins,
                the first step is a thorough review of the requirements.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4>Wireframes Before Code</h4>
              <p>
                To remove abstraction, wireframes are made to demonstrate the
                user experience and flow of any solution. Since interpretations
                differ, you can get an idea of how your project will function
                and get stakeholder buy-in before development begins.

              <h4>Milestones</h4>
              <p>
                While a guaranteed completion date sounds great, requirements
                change and needs evolve often making the date unreliable.
                Milestones give multiple check points to review and alter the
                project plan while allowing flexibility.

              <h4>Documentation</h4>
              <p>
                A beautiful, fully functional application really isn't worth
                that much if you don't know how it works. Without business
                process and technical documentation, you waste time and money
                every time you need to alter it.

          <h3>Programming with Best Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Let's not re-invent the wheel.
            <dfn title="üë¥">Many have come before us</dfn>, let's learn from
            them. I use best practices with proven, stable technology to solve
            problems the right way.

                PHP, Laravel, Testing &amp; Code Standards
              </h4>
              <p>
                Using Laravel, a <dfn title="üêò">PHP</dfn> framework, I create
                MVC-based architecture with thorough unit tests. High test
                coverage percentage is a guide, not a goal. To follow a coding
                standard and ensure quality, I implement PHP Code Sniffer and
                static analysis.

              <p>
                I build apps with the reactive JavaScript framework VueJS. Unit,
                integration and snapshot testing is a staple of any project I
                develop. I guarantee standard-compliant code with ESLint.

              <p>
                Browsers are capable of a wide range of functionality when the
                proper HTML and CSS is used. To guarantee platform-native
                experiences, I implement browser-supported controls using HTML5
                and CSS3.

              <p>
                Git provides code history logging, security and quick deployment
                tools. Whether as a single developer or part of a large team,
                version control is a necessity.
