          Creating a requirements document for a project can seem daunting. Where do I start? What sections are
          required? How do I capture everything and keep scope limited?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no perfect "right" answers as each situation is different. However, the purpose of this page is to
          give you some guidance about what a requirements document and wireframe might look like. I‚Äôve created a fake
          company called <strong>Fizzle Stix</strong> which wants to create an app called <strong>Mass Status for
            Slack</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôre a developer or consultant, you can use this as a set of guidelines or an example of how you might
          create your own wireframe and requirements document.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôre a prospective business client, this will show you a very simple, contrived example of the type of
          work you can expect out of a requirements gathering engagement with More Better Faster.

        <h3>What Should I Create?</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different levels of detail you might include in the process of gathering requirements. Some
          would say that you should include as much detail as possible so you can quote and build things accurately.
          Others that preach an agile approach say that requirements are a waste of time because project needs change to
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to fall somewhere in the middle. Requirements documents and wireframes give a good start to a project.
          They develop a communication process and a shared vocabulary between two parties. They help get a vision out
          of the head of the business owner. They allow a developer to confirm that they understand that vision. But,
          they are not the Bible; they can and should change and be updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, I tend to create a semi-detailed requirements document and a relatively detailed wireframe.
          On a detail level from least at 1 to most at 10, I do a 5 for a requirements document and an 8 for a
          wireframe.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a requirements document?</h4>
        <p>
          Generally a requirements document contains business goals and details mixed with technical specs. It is a
          written version of the functionality of the project. It may also detail both how and why of each feature to
          provide context. I tend to use Pages or Microsoft Word and then export as a PDF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Requirements documents may contain assumptions, concerns, and features so that all members of the team are on
          board. Nothing‚Äôs worse than finding out 3 months into the project that ‚Äúwe just assumed that you would do
          xyz‚Ä¶‚Äù - so that‚Äôs where this document really shines. You think something should or may happen? Write it down.
          Do you plan to do something? Write it down.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a wireframe?</h4>
        <p>
          There are two forms of visual representation for projects: wireframes and mockups. Wireframes tend to be more
          sketch-like and not have as much visual detail. Their job is to help visually describe functionality without
          getting bogged down on stylistic choices. They are useful to show workflows. I tend to use Balsamiq or
          PencilApp to create the wireframes and export them as a PDF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mockups tend to be more stylistically filled in versions of mockups. Therefore they take longer. Depending on
          the needs of your project, you may have both wireframes or mockups. I tend to believe that wireframes are part
          of the defining stage of a project, and mockups are part of the designing / building stage.

        <h3>Requirements Document</h3>
        <p>
          The sections I‚Äôve added here are just examples of how I start out my requirements document. Sometimes I end up
          expanding the sections or removing them entirely. Let‚Äôs take a look at the sections.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Executive Summary</strong>
            This is what it sounds like - just a quick few paragraphs that say what this project is and who its for.
            Don‚Äôt get bogged down in technology or deliverability: just who is it and what do they want.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>
            Here is where you define the problem that this project is trying to solve. This is important because this
            context helps all understand what the point is. If everyone understands ‚Äúthe point‚Äù they can make better
            autonomous decisions throughout the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assumptions</strong>
            This section is a great place to list all of the things that you assume are the case. That is to say, what
            you find reasonable or ‚Äúobvious‚Äù may not be the same for every stakeholder. List those things here. For
            example, in the tech world we may never do XYZ thing, but business people might not know that. That should
            be explicitly listed here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Risks / Concerns</strong>
            There are risks and concerns in any project. This is a great place to list things that are risks or perhaps
            things out of your control that may affect the project. Especially when relationships need to be created or
            third parties control some of the success of the project, this section should be used.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Technical Requirements</strong>
            Most of the document has been for the business side of the project. This section is the open section for
            your the technical people that are part of the project. Throughout the research of the project, you may have
            found out specific technical challenges or services that need to be used. It‚Äôs also a great place to just
            very much detail the functionality and features. Nothing here in this section can be too detailed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Out of Scope</strong>
            In the same vein as assumptions, out of scope is a place to write down things that you ‚Äúknow‚Äù but should
            still be documented. What features were maybe talked about that didn‚Äôt make it into this final project? What
            adjacent things could you touch, but you‚Äôre not going to?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Milestones</strong>
            We‚Äôre not going too far down the project management rabbit hole in this section, but we are sharing some
            milestones. Consider these checkpoints or logical progressions of a project. Sometimes these are useful to
            indicate when partial payment might happen for those who bill this way. I find it useful to help keep
            everyone on the same page when it comes to schedule and the linear parts of the project. Stakeholders know
            how far along they are in the project and what‚Äôs next.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your requirements document may have all of these sections, or more, or less. These are just an example of
          sections I‚Äôve found useful over time creating many of these documents.
        </p>
        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <p>
          Each wireframe will be different for each project obviously. Some may be more detailed and some less. Here are
          a few thoughts I have when considering creating a wireframe.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Same Size Viewport</strong>
            Make the wireframes use all the same size of view port. That is to say, if you‚Äôre making a browser window,
            make sure all of them are the size of a browser window. Same thing with app. When you swap back and forth
            between sizes, it can be confusing then if this is a mobile view of something, or a browser, or a zoomed in
            part, or the entire screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Demonstrate workflow</strong>
            When possible, make elements clickable and anchor them to other places in the wireframe. This helps more
            visible people navigate workflow and wrap their head around it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annotate when necessary</strong>
            Most of the screen should be self-explanatory. However, when certain things are necessary to know behind the
            scenes (like, this will not show if they‚Äôre not an admin), use annotations to explain that
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refrain from colors</strong>
            Sometimes colors are ok, but try to stay in grayscale and do very little shading. The point of the wireframe
            is to imitate a napkin sketch, not a photoshop file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don‚Äôt fret over icons</strong>
            Don‚Äôt worry if your wireframe tool doesn‚Äôt offer the exact UI or icons you want. Just get your point across.
            Designers can put a great polish on this during mockups.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I‚Äôve had wireframes that were a fraction of the requirements document, and I‚Äôve had ones that were twenty
          times more pages. It just depends on what is the best and easiest ways to describe your requirements for each
          unique project.

        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>
          Requirement documentation is a hard process, but it‚Äôs worth it. You learn a lot about the project, develop a
          shared vocabulary, and can build a project plan throughout the process. Wireframes help with those who are
          more visual or in situations where a visual representation is more efficient and effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          These documents have multiple parts that are a bit mix and match. Don‚Äôt worry too much about if you‚Äôve built
          them correctly with the right sections - this comes with practice. It‚Äôs just about getting it all out of
          everyone‚Äôs heads and down on paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this page has helped explain my rationale and given you an example or guideline to follow. If you have
          any questions, please let me know.
