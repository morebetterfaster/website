          Hi! I'm <strong class="aaron">Aaron Saray</strong>, and I'm a programming and dev coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do I get to the next level as a developer? Why doesn't the programming team show more progress? How is
          growth and success measured in a development role? Do any of these questions sound familiar? Don't worry, I
          can help.

        <h3>What Does Coaching Achieve?</h3>
        <p>
          I specialize in taking anyone from a junior programmer to a <a
            href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31673/10x-developer" target="_blank">10x developer</a> and
          coaching them to become what I call the <strong>
            <def title="1x10 = 10, 1x5^5 = 3125">5x^5 programmer</def>
          </strong>: 5 times more productive than the average developer, with 5 areas of focus that elevate them even
          further.
        </p>

            <h4>Empathy</h4>
            <p>
              When programmers are more open to feeling empathetic, two great things happen. First, they are more
              connected to the user experience. They will push aside any ambivalence and fight for the best thing for
              the customer. Second, they'll make decisions to make their code easier to understand and maintain for
              their fellow team member or the next developer.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>
              Every industry, every business, every group says the same thing "communication is key." Yet, a lot of
              developers have yet to master this key responsibility. Programmers need to communicate to demonstrate
              their work as well as explain the value of their decisions.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>
              If "What" is the business and "How" is the code, "Why" is the documentation. Most programmers don't like
              documentation because they haven't had a chance to see the value of it. Proper documentation techniques
              and workflows make what used to be a bore into something that all coders can be proud of.

          <div>
            <h4>Insight</h4>
            <p>
              The capacity to understand the intricate details of the business and the problems to be solved make a
              stronger
              programmer. A developer begins as a coder, but becomes a problem solver by gaining deeper insight into
              processes.

          <div>
            <h4>Foresight</h4>
            <p>
              Looking ahead is an under-developed skill by most developers. This is not about using the newest
              technology on the market
              (unless that's appropriate), it's about understanding the impact of current decisions on the future of the
              code and project.
              What does a programming decision now mean for the future? What changes might the company make next year?

        <h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
        <p>
          When I take on a new client, I learn their goals,
          listen to their concerns and develop a plan that helps us get measurable results. This takes time. This
          requires a commitment. There is no quick fix or easy panacea. But, we do have options on how we might work
          together.
        </p>
        <div class="point">
          <span>üìÖ</span>
          <div>
            <h4>
              Monthly
            </h4>
            <p>
              Either once or twice a month is the most common, most effective engagement. We'll set specific goals and
              work towards milestones during our video calls. My goal is to help make significant improvements, but I
              can't always predict the timetable for this. You do have my word that I will coach effectively during the
              time we've agreed. If I feel I can't provide enough value for your investment, I'll be the first to tell
              you and help wrap things up.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Condensed Report
            </h4>
            <p>
              Sometimes engaging for a few months can seem scary or daunting. I get that. I do provide an alternative
              which is a condensed engagement. We will find a few times that
              work for us, and meet in a more accelerated manner. I don't recommend this for most developers, but there
              are some situations that
              may benefit from a more targeted, rigorous plan.

        <h3>But I Have Questions...</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, what are they?
        </p>
        <div class="point">
          <span>?</span>
          <div>
            <h4>Did I read that right? You want to slow down my 10x Dev?</h4>
            <p>
              "Productivity" - which is usually an alias for "speed" - without restraint and constraint is dangerous.
              When you jerk the steering wheel going 120 miles an hour, it's much more dangerous than at 60. Good
              programmers rely solely on speed. Great programmers holistically solve problems.

        <div class="point">
          <span>?</span>
          <div>
            <h4>Can't you just tell me what I need to improve on my own?</h4>
            <p>
              Programmers are very smart. You probably can identify a lot of your surface challenges, so you're
              equipped to solve them yourself. As a coach, I dig in deeper by getting to know you, learning about your
              history and experience, and observing your work. Just like with programming, more complex goals require
              planning and structured solutions. So... no.
            </p>

            <h4>Will I receive detailed status reports if you coach one of my developers?</h4>
            <p>
              As managers, we must remember that we are just stewards of a programmer's career, and enjoy the benefits
              of their growth while they're a member of our team. You've made the right decision investing in them;
              but this is an investment in them, not for you. I give factual, attendance-based reports if required,
              but I will not share the specifics of coaching sessions. It's important to provide an atmosphere where
              things can be discussed, challenged, and explored with no fear of any judgement or repercussions for
              someone to grow.
