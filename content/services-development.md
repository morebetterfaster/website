Whether youâ€™re a lone-wolf or managing a group, when you add MBF to your project you bring industry best practices and solid development processes.

## Process Implementation

We're not robots, so sometimes we need a little process help. Since programming projects require precise accuracy and measurement, good process is essential.

### Requirements Analysis

Analyzing the requirements before coding helps clarify business objectives and eliminate rework. Before any programming begins, the first step is a thorough review of the requirements.

### Wireframes Before Code

To remove abstraction, wireframes are made to demonstrate the user experience and flow of any solution. Since interpretations differ, you can get an idea of how your project will function and get stakeholder buy-in before development begins.

### Milestones

While a guaranteed completion date sounds great, requirements change and needs evolve often making the date unreliable. Milestones give multiple check points to review and alter the project plan while allowing flexibility.

### Documentation

A beautiful, fully functional application really isn't worth that much if you don't know how it works. Without business process and technical documentation, you waste time and money every time you need to alter it.

## Programming with Best Practices

Let's not re-invent the wheel. Many have come before us, let's learn from them. MBF uses best practices with proven, stable technology to solve problems the right way.

### PHP, Laravel, Testing & Code Standards

Using Laravel, a PHP framework, MVC-based architecture is created with thorough unit tests. High test coverage percentage is a guide, not a goal. To follow a coding standard and ensure quality, PHP Code Sniffer and static analysis is implemented.

### Javascript, Vue, Testing & Code Standards

Web apps are built with the reactive JavaScript framework VueJS. Unit, integration and snapshot testing is a staple of any MBF project. Standard-compliant code is guaranteed with ESLint.

### The Newest HTML5 & CSS3

Browsers are capable of a wide range of functionality when the proper HTML and CSS is used. To guarantee platform-native experiences, MBF implements browser-supported controls using HTML5 and CSS3.

### Git Version Control

Git provides code history logging, security and quick deployment tools. Whether as a single developer or part of a large team, version control is a necessity.

## Available Engagements

There are three types of hands-on options available.  All options are a subscription-based engagement style pre-paid at the beginning of the month for the month's work.  **We do not track hours or bill hourly.** We
enjoy scoping conversations and doing either weekly or monthly planning. 

Each option comes with a team member cross-trained with access to your application and code for purposes of disaster recovery. (For single consultant engagements, you likely will not work with the other team member very often - less to manage that way!).

All new clients of development services enjoy a full, 100% money back guarantee of the first month's work. This way you can see what style of work you're going to get, how we interact and the quality of the output.

### Single Consultant

{{< pricing-label "$5000/mo" >}}

One consultant splits their work time between your project and only up to 3 other client projects. One objective or task is focused on at a time. This linear process is cost effective, easy to forecast and a nice way to keep your project going in the right direction.

### Two Consultants

{{< pricing-label "$9500/mo" >}}

Two consultants split their work time between your project.  **Two** objectives or tasks are done at the same time. This option allows work to continue even if you're not available immediately to address any questions or changes. 

### Dedicated Consultant

{{< pricing-label "$18000/mo" "sold" >}}

While we operate strictly as consultants, this arrangement feels just like having another team member on your staff.  You can expect most of the week to be dedicated to your project's work. You may find a stronger integration with your team with
this option as the consultant may choose to attend daily stand-ups and other planning meetings.  This consultant only works as a back up or disaster-recovery resource for other consultants besides their main focus on your project.

If you have a large amount of work to do, or need a lot of hands-on organization and help being removed from vendor-lock-in, this option is probably where you want to go.
