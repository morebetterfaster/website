            Hi! I'm <strong class="aaron">Aaron Saray</strong>, a PHP developer
            who specializes in Laravel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you find yourself wondering if you‚Äôre constructing your project
            <q><dfn title="üëç">the right way?</dfn></q> Do you have some
            architecture questions that you want to run by someone? Or maybe you
            just need <dfn title="üëÄ">a second opinion</dfn>. I‚Äôd love to help
            by providing a professional code review.
          </p>

          <h3>What Does This Involve?</h3>
          <p>
            Each engagement is different because each project and developer is
            unique. I start out with a basic framework, then tailor it for each
            individual code base.
          </p>
          <div class="point">
            <span>üîí</span>
            <div>
              <h4>Security</h4>
              <p>
                User data and business intelligence are the most important parts
                of your project. I spend a significant amount of time reviewing
                the code and dependencies for security holes and potential
                vulnerabilities. We‚Äôll identify risk factors and any steps to
                remedy them.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="point">
            <span>‚Ñ¢</span>
            <div>
              <h4>The Laravel Way</h4>
              <p>
                The Laravel framework community encourages specific paradigms
                for your project. Consistently implementing code following these
                patterns has many benefits.
              </p>

          </div>
          <div class="point">
            <span>üèé</span>
            <div>
              <h4>Performance</h4>
              <p>
                It doesn‚Äôt matter how beautiful your code is if your site is
                slow. Each additional second your site takes to load results in
                lost visitors, conversions and revenue. My thorough code review
                focuses on performance metrics and helps to discover additional
                efficiencies.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="point">
            <span>{ }</span>
            <div>
              <h4>PHP, Vue, JS, CSS Essentials</h4>
              <p>
                Your project is likely made up of more than just Laravel code
                and configuration. Individual PHP classes and functionality, Vue
                and Javascript, CSS and HTML also fall into the scope of this
                code review.

          <h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
          <p>
            Building a stronger code base, a beautiful product and expanding
            your skills as a developer takes <dfn title="üïê">time</dfn>. I like
            to develop long-term relationships with developers, but I do
            understand that sometimes you just need a quick one-time review.
          </p>
          <div class="point">
            <span>üìÖ</span>
            <div>
              <h4>
                Monthly
              </h4>
              <p>
                With my comprehensive code review comes a number of suggestions.
                But, without guidance, those can be misinterpreted or left
                behind. A monthly retainer agreement guarantees a long-lasting
                relationship where the coaching goes beyond a single code
                review. Not only do we work through the initial findings, we can
                make structured deep-dives into other parts of your project and
                process. It‚Äôs like having a senior developer or coach at hand
                whenever you need them, but not having to put up with them when
                you don‚Äôt!
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="point">
            <span>‚úì</span>
            <div>
              <h4>
                One Time
              </h4>
              <p>
                For those who just need a laser-targeted single review, a
                flat-rate engagement makes most sense. This choice also helps
                you understand the kind of feedback I‚Äôll give, the quality you
                can expect, and a general measurement of your project. Although
                this is called a one-time code review, we usually end up having
                two or three screen sharing calls to finalize your code review.

            With nearly 2 decades, I‚Äôve learned the best practices that make a
            PHP project successful. Since the release of Laravel 5, I specialize
            and solely build PHP applications in Laravel. Let‚Äôs schedule an
            initial call for me to learn about your project and let you know how
            I can help. If I can‚Äôt help you out, I‚Äôll try to connect you with
            someone who can. It‚Äôs as easy as clicking the link below!
